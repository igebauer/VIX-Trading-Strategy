# Results: VIX Trading Strategy Backtest

This document summarizes the outputs generated by the VIX Trading Strategy project.  
All results are reproducible using the scripts in this repository.

# Key Finding

A naive volatility trading backtest appears highly profitable under unrealistic assumptions.

After progressively incorporating realistic market mechanics:

- VIX ETF beta vs spot VIX
- Regime-dependent contango/backwardation decay
- Transaction costs and slippage
- Realistic signal execution

**Annualized returns dropped from ~61.5% → ~2.7%**

This represents a **98.5% reduction** in performance once realistic assumptions are applied.

**Conclusion:**  
Ignoring market microstructure and ETF mechanics can dramatically overstate strategy performance.

## Naive Backtest (V1)
**File:** `images/backtesting.png`

This chart shows results from the **initial naive strategy** using simplified assumptions:

- Direct VIX signal trading
- No realistic ETF decay modeling
- Minimal transaction costs
- No regime awareness

**Observation:**  
The equity curve appears highly profitable and stable, suggesting strong returns (~61.5% annualized).  
However, these results rely on unrealistic assumptions about how VIX-linked ETFs behave.

This serves as the baseline demonstration of how volatility strategies can look deceptively profitable.

## Improved Backtest with added VIX ETF Decay (V2)
**File:** `images/backtesting_v2.png`

This version introduces more realistic mechanics:

- Added ~5% monthly structural decay to model VIX ETF contango
- More realistic trade behavior

**Observation:**  
Returns drop compared to the naive model.  
This demonstrates how accounting for decay materially impacts performance.

Still optimistic, but far more realistic than V1.

## Backtest Performance Comparison
**File:** `images/backtest_comparison.png` *(or your generated filename)*

Shows:
- V1 naive strategy equity curve
- V2 improved model

Highlights the dramatic reduction in returns after realistic modeling.

# Generated CSV Outputs

These files are created when running the backtesting scripts.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `vix_spy_data.csv` | Cleaned historical VIX + SPY dataset |
| `v1_v2_comparison.csv` | Comparison of v1 and v2 |
| `v2_vs_v3_comparison.csv` | Comparison of v2 and v3 |

These CSVs allow independent verification of results and further analysis.
